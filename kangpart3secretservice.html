<h3>US Secret Service: The Fundamental Problem of Budget and Staffing</h3>
<div id="abcd">


<p> Ever since its founding in 1865, the United States Secret Service has boasted a highly regarded reputation of 
    command and intelligence in its portrayals in media, films, television, and even video games. 
    Its main duties are widely known to be enforcing the law and protecting the nation’s leaders, 
    while the agency is also responsible for combating cryptocurrency and cybersecurity issues. However, 
    the Secret Service has been increasingly facing problems of staff shortages in the face of its 
    deepening budget crisis. Its other issues of employee morale and technological shortcomings are 
    interconnected as well, greatly impacting the branch’s ability to effectively incorporate staff 
    efforts. While potential solutions such as shortening hiring processes and expanding positions and
     new technology have attempted to address complications, they have been largely short-term. <strong>The most
      reasonable and optimal solution would be to allot a greater budget for the agency in first 
      expanding administrative Secret Service positions in order to better regulate and uplift employee
       morale and thus boost recruitment and contain misconduct. </strong>There are also several methods 
       involving other government branches in cutting down costs and getting a greater budget.
</p>
<p class="body1">
    A common perception of Secret Service agents is that their jobs are flashy and exciting. 
While some agents may attest to this, the Secret Service is actually ranked as the 18th worst place to work in the government out of 415 departments of jobs (bestplacestowork.org, 2019). Agents often work overtime, with a comparatively meager salary, and under strained conditions. 
The average amount of overtime worked per uniformed division officers has increased by 65% from 362 hours in 2013 to 597 hours in 2015 (Roth, 2015). In addition, the Federal News Network has found the Secret Service have ranked last in terms of employee morale among 15 other agencies with similar missions (Ogrysko, 2017). A more current phenomenon is that the Secret Service simply does not have the capacity to protect Trump’s family and affiliations and oversee all of their traveling and estate activities. The agency, already low on funds,  must now protect 35% more people under Trump’s administration (not including the costs of every individual’s trips) than from Obama’s era (Arrieta-Kenna, 2017). With insufficient budget and manpower, it is thus no wonder that the Secret Service is having a hard time recruiting staff despite its urgent need for more uniformed division officers, special agents, professional and technical staff, and administrative workers. 
</p>
<p class="body2">
    External pressures also contribute to the limited manpower of the Secret Service. Government agents are paid relatively low compared to their duties and to the salaries made by agents working for private companies. While both public and private national security workers are on average paid into the six-figures, those working for private companies experience better job conditions (Johnson, 2017). Maryland congressman Elijah Cummings comments on the agency’s budget and staffing crisis: “We cannot expect the Secret Service to be able to recruit and keep the best of the best if they are not being paid for these increases [in overtime hours]” (Helmore, 2017). The combination of less-than satisfactory work conditions and temptations by private companies pose a threat to the Secret Service in terms of keeping its agents and maintaining good morale.

<p class="body3">
    The process of hiring for the Secret Service has been shortened in attempt to increase personnel and staffing at a faster rate. What once took the agency 15 months now takes around 4 months for brigining in new employees according to Randolph Alles, the Secret Service director in a 2017  House Homeland Security Transportation and Protective Security Subcommittee hearing (Alles, 2017). Furthermore, Alles and other administrators have recognized the need to hire about 1,700 more employees by 2022 in order to effectively complete operational and investigative priorities. However, such a shortened recruitment process brings about problems such as lower quality and incompetency of workers and a higher potential risk of misconduct. Inspector General of Department of Homeland Security John Roth has pointed out that the already present lack of enough human resources to appropriately conduct position descriptions and the hiring process. In an investigation of the Secret Service hiring process, Roth found, “When we asked for data, for example, they couldn’t give us real-time data as to how many people were in the pipeline [and] where they were, because they didn’t have any data systems to track the kind of hiring they need. This is something that is fundamental and basic in any private corporation or private industry” (oig.dhs.gov, 2019). 

</p>
<p class="body4">A contributing obstacle to recruitment and employee productivity in the Secret Service is the agency’s IT systems, which are used to track open positions and new hires. Roth describes the Secret Service data systems outdated, with workers having to manually input and transfer employment details (Alles, 2017). A negative consequence from bygone technology include more embarrassing breaches for the agency and miscommunication (another characteristic of a low-morale work environment). While the agency has recently created a web-based platform called “Spark!” to facilitate more efficient access/communication of information, positive effects on staffing are yet to materialize (Apache.org, 2019) . In addition, rising threats in cybersecurity and cryptocurrency, especially from China and Russia, cause the Secret Service’s technological shortcomings to further strain employees. This causes a lack of consistent regulation in anti-money laundering and supervision over illicit activity (Stanley, 2018). In conclusion, the Secret Service’s lack in more modern technological systems slows down the recruitment process and further strains current employees in quantity that can be prevented but otherwise damaging work morale.
</p>

<p class="body5">The cycle of staffing shortages, low morale,  and technological inadequacies all stem from the Secret Service’s lack of a sufficient budget. To find a long-term solution, Congress must allot a higher budget with which the Secret Service can first fixate on technological solutions in order to improve its employee morale and thus bring in better recruitments. A higher budget would also entail better staff training and a revert to a more extensive and longer recruitment process in order to ensure less breaches and misconduct in the agency. The most obvious way to give the Secret Service a higher budget is through cutting shares from other government sectors that already received the highest portions such as the Environmental Protection Agency and NASA (Gianfortune, 2018). Other possibilities are to perhaps cap services from unlimited personal travel by the president and their affiliates to keep costs down. While the cost of President Obama’s travel totaled roughly $97 million for the entire eight years of his presidency, Donald Trump’s travel cost taxpayers $20 million in just the first eighty days (Allen, 2017). With the current president draining the department’s budgets to record highs, restricting their activities becomes a necessity. In terms of staffing morale, the Secret Service should instill increased disciplinary and accountability standards among workers to prevent breaches and garner higher collaboration and trust. Improving communication platforms like the Spark! Initiative is a novel first step. Finally, though the agency is lacking in jobs like uniformed division officers and accountants, it should expand the number of professional administrators, rather than agents or officers, responsible for budgeting and workforce functions. The Heritage Foundation suggests that a larger suite of professional administrators could support and improve planning and execution of core responsibilities (Inserra, 2019). </p>
<p class="conclusion">
    While the Secret Service continues to evolve to meet budgetary and staffing challenges through adjustments to recruitments, improvements in technology, and expansion in administration, the most practical solution would be to increase the agency’s budget by possibly a combination of limiting the activists of the protectees and capping budgets in other government sectors for a higher portion dedicated to the Secret Service. Through increasing the budget and capacity, the agency should then focus on reforming and expanding internal administrative duties to improve overall regulation, conduct, and confidence of all agents. Only through increasing the budget may the US Secret Service effectively address its decade-long issue of manpower.
